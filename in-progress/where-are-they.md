Rachel Held Evans is the latest Millennial voice claiming that her (and my) generation is tired of Praise and Preaching centered evangelical churches, and that there is a growing movement towards liturgical worship --- a movement which is drawing young(ish) folks into the Episcopal Church.

They like our ancient rituals, they like the depth of meaning, they like the stability, the quality of music, the profundity. So we hear, anyway.

Discussing these things with a particularly traditionalist friend of mine, the question that many of us have been thinking was (finally) expressed: 

If that's true, _where are these people?_

While I am aware of a tiny handful of Episcopal parishes that are experiencing growth, I am aware of exponentially more that are losing members, dwindling into a slow and steady death spiral. 

But we keep hearing that the Episcopal Church is somehow perfectly positioned to draw in, evangelize, minister to, and commission into ministry a young generation that desires the depth of tradition and the profundity of liturgy, without the political baggage and sexism of (for example) Roman Catholicism.

And yet:

If that's true, _where are these people?_

Should we assume that the movement isn't all that it's made out to be? Should we imagine that Evans, and others, are simply outliers with a megaphone, unrepresentative of the larger trends in their generation?

Yes and no, I think. 

On the one hand, it is clearly false that a majority of millennials are interested in liturgy or tradition or spirituality. The majority of millennials are not interested in anything in particular --- the major story of the millennial generation(s) is interest-based tribalism. Everyone is weird, and everyone is finding other people who are weird like them. Everyone is part of a subculture.

But, on the other hand, every one of these subcultures is large enough to support the kind of social support network that human beings need. The fact of the matter is that there are _a lot of people_ in this country. It doesn't take a very large percentage of them to have a substantial tribe.

I recently lived in a minor suburb of Fort Worth, which had 39,000 people in it (according to the city-limits sign). Every town within a ten-minute drive (probably 5 or 6) had "Welcome to" signs boasting another 30 or 40 thousand people. What type of percentages need to work out for a place like this to have a thriving parish?

I am fully convinced that even the tiny percentage of people (millennials and others) who are in personal need of all the things the Episcopal Church can offer is more than large enough to (at least) pack all the current church buildings and even build a few more. 

But...

If that's true, _where are these people?_

You don't want to know what I think.
You will disagree. You will be offended. You will protest. 

Or maybe you'll sort-of agree with me, but you will be absolutely convinced your parish is the exception. Or your whole diocese. Or your part of the country. 

But here's what I think.

There are two reasons that this apparent movement toward tradition and liturgy and depth is not resulting in more people (young or old) showing up our parishes.

1. Our liturgies are bad.
2. No one knows about them.

### What do you mean our liturgies are bad?

I mean they are bad.

I do not mean that they do not live up to my own personal tastes, preferences, and piety. I do not mean that they aren't sufficiently High Church, or sufficiently contemporary, or sufficiently Anglo-Catholic, or sufficiently youth-oriented. I don't mean that people don't follow the rubrics well enough, or that people follow the rubrics too slavishly, or that people do not sing this or that piece of music the way I think they should.

I mean that liturgy is just bad.

Every time I read or hear some lifelong Episcopalian rhapsodize on how beautiful the liturgy is, how traditional, how meaningful, how moving, I honestly think to myself: Where do you experience _that_?!

I can only assume that these random lifers go to some church I have never been to. And that they don't get around much.

Because here is what I've seen.

I have attended Sunday morning, or evening Holy Day, liturgy at about 40 parishes in five different states over the last few years, including several years where I was a music director at one.

This is what I have experienced at (let's say) 37 of them.

 - Pregame. Check the website. (If they even have one.)
    - What time is service? I can't find it!
       - Maybe the Mass times will be listed in the About Us page? No. 
       - Do they have a calendar? No.
       - Oh, I found a PDF download of a bulletin from last year. It says they meet at 10:30. I hope that is still true. (Sometimes it is. But not always.)
    - Where are they located?
       - Do they have an address listed?
       - Maybe on the About Us page? No.
       - Oh here it is!
       - Wait. Why can't I copy-and-paste it? Why did they decide to make the address an image and not text?!?!?!
 - Arrival
    - One of the following two things:
       - No one says anything.
       - Ten people get excited because we are the first visitors (with a child!!) that they have seen in a decade.
    - "We have a nursery."
       - No thanks.
    - "Would you like me to take him to the nursery?"
       - We're good.
    - "By the way, did you know we have a nursery?"
       - Yeah, I heard.
    - "Did someone show you where the nursery is?"
       - Yes.
    - "We love having children here in liturgy."
       - Sure doesn't feel that way.
 - Find a seat, look around.
    - Cannot find the bathroom.
    - Find the bathroom. No place to change a diaper.
    - Gosh, the altar sure is far away.
    - Clutter.
    - If they rearranged the space a little, it could be really nice.
          -Sigh.
    - Where is everyone?
 - During Mass
    - Program with a jumble of fonts. Hard to read. Hard to follow. 
    - Juggling act with Prayer Book, Hymnal, insert, and child. 
     - Old hymns played slowly on an organ.
     - Why isn't anyone else singing?
     - Poorly read scripture lessons (reader mumbles through text).
     - Homilies with a weird combination of progressive triumphalism and liberal guilt.
    - (Try to keep child quiet.)
    - (People turn around and glare at child.)
     - Music choices that seems completely random (texts seems to have nothing to do with the day, season, or lessons).
    - General sloppiness, confusion, clutter.
    - Why is the altar so far away?
     - Prayers and hymn texts refer to all people as "men."
    - "It was wonderful to have your son here. He's so quiet!"
        - Yeah, but what if he hadn't been?

In short --- it is bad.

This has been the case at "high church" places as well as "low;" at rich parishes and poor; at urban, suburban, and rural parishes; in huge historic buildings and tiny makeshift chapels; at liturgies advertised as "traditional," "contemporary", "family-friendly", and "choral"; at parishes with large semi-professional choirs and parishes with volunteer organists; at parishes that describe themselves as "Anglo-Catholic," "broad church," "protestant," and "evangelical".

Places that claim to be doing contemporary music are doing bad camp songs from the 1970s. Places that claim to be doing traditional music are doing boring hymns from the 1870s. "Tradition" seems to mean "what I sort of remember from growing up." 

(And don't even get me started on the absolutely horrifying, and all-too prevalent, practice of segregating teenagers into a monthly "Youth Mass" instead of simply including them into a unified community every Sunday.)

You may not believe me, but this is not a case of a liturgy that just doesn't live up to my own preferences or artistic standards. Frankly, my artistic standards are pretty low, and my preferences are remarkably broad.

I _like_ church music. I like chant, polyphony, English choral music, Shape note hymns, Catholic folk songs, actual folk song, Praise Bands, world music. There is a hardly a genre of religious music that I dislike.

And I love liturgy.

Well, in theory I do. 

And in real-life I occasionally actually do love it. 

I believe that the Eucharist is (to use a Roman Catholic phrase) the "source and summit" of the Christian life. I think that liturgy has a profound and powerful effect on people, that it forms community, calls us to mission, and draws us into the mystery of Christ's death and resurrection.

So why am I so bored when I go to church?

Is it just me? Am I expecting too much? Too little? Am I selfish, or snobbish, or shallow?

Maybe yes to all those, except --- I don't think it's just me.

I look around at these parishes, at the people in these congregations. I know they are good people. I know they are faithful people. And they look just as bored as me (when they aren't looking irritated at my child's noise).

I don't see anyone who looks enraptured by the (sometimes) beautiful choral music. I don't see a look of enlightenment at any of the supposedly profound things being said in sermons. I don't see anything that indicates that any of the people in the room are actually the least bit interested in any of the things that are happening WAY OVER THERE in the sanctuary.

And even if it is _just me_, is it really _just me_? 

If my problems with typical Episcopal liturgy are somehow MY PROBLEMS and not (as I suspect) something profoundly wrong with the way we, as a church, approach worship:

 - Are we really willing to say that all the other people who are like me (self-absorbed, elitist millennials with no respect for their elders) are basically a lost cause? 
 - Are we willing to continue to behave as if it is the job of unchurched people to _get with the program_ (the one I can't read), and find their place in a liturgy that is alienating even to the people who grew up in it?

I donâ€™t think so, even though we do act that way more often than not.

### Why aren't we being swamped by tradition-seeking Millennials?

If there ARE tradition-seeking Millennials out there longing for The Episcopal Church, there is small chance that any of them will ever set foot in an Episcopal church to begin with.

Do you want to know why the megachurch down the street from you has so many people at it? Perhaps its the Praise Band. Perhaps its the casual atmosphere. Perhaps its the preaching. But I will bet you that that church also has a website that makes it clear what time services are and what you can expect when you get there. They've told their members to tell other people. They've likely done mailings. And pay-per-click ads. And billboards. And YouTube videos.

A few stories:

 - On Good Friday this year, I was planning to look after my son while my wife went to church in the evening, so I was looking for a place to go during the day. Since I like serious choral music a bit more than my wife does (or my son can appreciate), I thought I'd go to a nearby parish that has lackluster liturgy but really excellently performed choral music. I went to their website. I could not find any mention at all about the schedule for their Good Friday liturgy. None at all. I spent more than ten minutes looking for it, even trying to download bulletins to see if it was mentioned in the announcements. I never found it, or any other mention of when Triduum services were.

 - A few years ago my wife's mother and sister (Roman Catholics) decided to try out the local Episcopal parish one Sunday. My sister-in-law got her toddler ready to go (always an undertaking) and managed to make it to their Sunday meeting place (a rented facility) on time. Except no one was there. It turns out the parish had moved locations, and never bothered to update their website.

 - When my wife and I first moved to the Diocese of Fort Worth, we tried using the internet to find a parish. This was about a year or two after the departure of the former Bishop and all of that madness. It took quite a bit of searching, reading, and puzzle-solving to figure out what was going on. If I didn't already have a vague understanding of the conflicts within the Anglican Communion, I would never have known why there were two websites for the Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth. It was nearly impossible to tell what parishes were actually Episcopal and which were not, and even which diocesan website was the right one. After I showed up I volunteered my services to help in this matter, and it took over year to convince enough people that any of this was actually a problem or that something could be done about it.

Its hard to grow a church if nobody can find you. 

 Too often we don't do tradition, we do habit.

Too often we do liturgy as if it isn't actually that important. Or even that interesting.

Too often we care more about choral performance than liturgical appropriateness.

Too often we think slow and boring is the same as solemn.

Too often we can't tell the difference between mysterious and confusing.

Too often we are fooling ourselves when we say we want children in our parishes.

Too often we preach as if we don't actually believe any of the things we say or do.

Too often the service times aren't listed on the website. There isn't a changing table in the bathroom. I don't have enough hands to hold the program, the insert, the BCP, the hymnal, and my child.

Because most people haven't even heard of us.

Because we'd rather blame uncontrollable cultural forces for our decline than take responsibility for reversing it.

Because even as I am writing this, I am unsure of whether I should publish it or not.

Because we hate change even more than we fear death, and we fear death even more than we believe in resurrection.
